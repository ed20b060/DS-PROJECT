# DS-PROJECT
DS Project
The program written can be used for preprocessing of the signals before passing into the DeepSleepnet. A fas fourier transform is applied on the data signals and then the frequency at which the maximum amplitude occurs is found. The given frequency is used as a lower cutoff value for the bandpass filter while the higher cutoff value is given as 20 Hz observed from the graphs which were plotted using the data. The data now has less noise and the signals are now much enhanced as compared to the previous.
